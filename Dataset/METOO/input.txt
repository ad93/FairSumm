0<||>Male<||>If a guy says he's nervous about #MeToo, just remind him that we come down pretty hard on murderers too, and ask him why that doesn't make him nervous. If he says, \"Because I haven't murdered anyone,\" then you've learned something new about your friend.
1<||>Male<||>Let's talk about absolute hypocrisy!  The left has stood by while these three have done their dirt!   Where's the outrage?!   Way to highjack #MeToo movement for political gain. Sad! https://t.co/ttMnUF8meD.

5<||>Female<||>@magali_c Oh happened to #metoo at @summerhouse, Delhi when we was just a newbie in the bloc! Kept feeling my back up and the first fanboying hug from my side lasted way too long and too feel-y! You know when the moment you realise this is too much. @KananGill.
6<||>Male<||>The left has hyjacked the #metoo movement. The left does not believe in innocent until proven guilty. The left does not believe in America first instead they would rather put every country ahead of the United States.

11<||>Female<||>I am not at all surprised that Suhel Seth's name has come up in the #MeToo conversation. For years he has preyed on young women, and the whisper network was ripe with stories of his depravity. I was 26 when he publicly harassed and humiliated me. No one stopped him. @MasalaBai.

27<||>Male<||>#MeToo has been elite, privileged, certainly not representative, and importantly, restricted to those who have access to this platform.  We need to talk about this.  Can we do so without discrediting this wave? Without invalidating the struggles of those who have spoken up?.

37<||>Female<||>An abusive relationship, however bad, is not #metoo. An affair gone bad is not #metoo. A man trying to flirt with you is not #metoo. A consensual relationship that fetched you benefits at one time is not #metoo in retrospect. Please don't dilute the movement.

44<||>Male<||>@dhanyarajendran @sruthihariharan I tweeted this earlier, repeating again. The reason why #metoo is fast losing its credibility is because of people like her.

264<||>Female<||>#metoo movt. is a great opportunity to think of what goes around us. The spotlight should be on everyday racism n sexism ard us in which even women are complicit. Careerist women who have no regard for decency n integrity, And both men n women who share the sense of entitlement.
265<||>Female<||>#Metoo shudn't be abt sympathy for others stories alone; it shud enable moments for our own self reflection. Everytime we kept quiet when we saw someone else being bullied n harassed becoz of our own selfish interests. #Metoo shud truly be an account of our own complicity too!

423<||>Male<||>Another day, another dirty trick to try to use the #metoo politics movement to undermine a Trump critic - today it\u2019s the Special Counsel. \u2066#WeSaidEnough\u2069 and will not be fooled: reject the LIES and #ProtectMueller! #TuesdayMotivation https://t.co/Xt4hrEcBRv
424<||>Male<||>@ANI I am sure from today onwards, no other women would dare to come out with #MeToo story.  These type of girls never realise, what kind of harm they are doing for #MeToo movement with this cheap behaviour.

432<||>Female<||>Still,better than my neighbour or'Stalker' as we like to call him,who I v gently turned down so naturally went on an intimidation spree, inc what felt like constantly standing outside my front door listening,which went on for 18ms. I was lucky, his ex said he was violent #metoo
433<||>Male<||>If the fear about #MeToo is false accusations against men, then the GOP SHOULDN'T BE OFFERING $$$ TO WOMEN TO MAKE FALSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ROBERT MUELLER!!! https://t.co/2yUJg5B2kE #AreWeGreatEnoughYet
434<||>Male<||>@kylegriffin1 Make no mistake. This is not only an attempt to discredit Mueller, but also to discredit the entire #MeToo movement. Expect to hear much complaining that Democrats won't believe this accuser after saying believe women.
435<||>Female<||>few male politicians are as active on behalf of women's rights as DNC chair @TomPerez. he gets honest about #MeToo, class disparities, and how all men's masculinity can become toxic: https://t.co/jYfJuauy77

And so true that the #metoo movement includes dads, sons and brothers w the Integrity, class, strength and grace to push back against primitive male traditions and behavior.

438<||>Male<||>My dream is that one day everyone will know what the words #MeToo signify. But they will be educated and will be able to protect themselves from predators so that they will never ever, ever have to say the words 'me too'.\" - @Aly_Raisman https://t.co/Y9bmda3fHd

440<||>Female<||>#WriteYourResistance I\u2019ll fully admit that the #MeToo movement is one of the reasons I\u2019m writing my Medusa project. Queer people experience a higher rate of sexual assault that often times goes unreported. https://t.co/GYwOE4ugcR
441<||>Female<||>Holy hell.... not only is Trump trying to escape an active &amp; effective investigation, he is also trying to mock the #MeToo movement. Repulsive. Thank you for bringing this to light. Sounds like a Roger Stone idea. #FBI #Mueller https://t.co/SdiIXeA03x

448<||>Female<||>Of course. The natural progression of labeling women who come forward with credible claims of assault against your allies as lying sluts is to weaponize #metoo against your enemies. They think it\u2019s a huge \u201cgotcha\u201d. Please prove them wrong. https://t.co/a2OGhcHnYb

453<||>Female<||>Apparently I'm only scared because of #metoo even though the movement didn't exist at the time
454<||>Male<||>@TheAcademy should learn that 'Marlina The Murderer in Four Acts' may be the most relevant film with #metoo this year. Pak @jokowi, @BekrafID, pak @Triawan and @cinesurya should actually discuss how to have 'Marlina' screened #MarlinaGoesToOscar
455<||>Female<||>AllOfItWNYC Wow, you were totally inadequate in pressing Caroline\u2019s owner on #MeToo. \u2022 CK was \u201cyounger,\u201d has been \u201cpaying his dues\u201d \u2013 where were your follow-up questions?  \u2022 \u201cThe kitchen gets hectic but they should come to me\u201d \u2013 really? That\u2019s sufficient from a club owner? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f
456<||>Male<||>@StatehouseChick The logic here is truly baffling.  A progressive political movement is responsible for elevating conservative women? The GOP only has 15 women in IL politics but that\u2019s something the #MeToo movement should solve for the party of Trump?  Lol.
457<||>Male<||>@TheRestlessQuil @autumnshade Sandhya, isnt the case same with others like Wire, NDTV etc. While you have been talking against all sccussed relentlessly, other vocal #MeToo warriors have gone missing post MJA resignation as if that was their only goal. No accountability sought ftom media houses.
458<||>Male<||>@bubblespre @Chinmayi False/Wrong accusation and not even an apology. disgusting!!!!! This is the danger behind #metoo and baseless accusations. Those who falsely/wrongly accuse others ought to be punished by law. Baseless accusations must have legal consequences. https://t.co/ePmfOYnLJB
459<||>Male<||>@NatashaBertrand @jaketapper Fox and Conservative media will roll with push this new theory and claim media is covering it up. They will try to shrink the gender gap just before the election. It's weaponizing #metoo the way they assumed Dems did against Kavanaugh. Probably what inspired this.
460<||>Female<||>I learned from #MeToo that if I cry rape on at least 7 different occassions against at least 7 different men, none of which were prosecuted, or charged for rape, I can get attention from victim advocates like Family Tree, org. I love me some attention. #WhenMimesSpeak #Satire?
461<||>Female<||>One of social movements, #Metoo is originated in 2006 and popularized on social media in october 2017. People tweets over 500,000 wthin first 24 hours. Remember, metoo is not just for women!!! #CSULB104

463<||>Male<||>So #Mueller is getting his #metoo moment. I am guessing Democrats won't think all women need to be believed anymore.
464<||>Male<||>Megyn Kelly is being fired because she shone too much light on NBC's #MeToo problem https://t.co/tR6cS29G2C
465<||>Male<||>Watch how fast @TheDemocrats &amp; #FakeNews smear #Mueller\u2019s #MeToo accusers as \u201ctrailer trash,\u201d \u201cpaid off,\u201d and \u201cliars,\u201d w/ or w/ out corroborating evidence.   As w/ #Kavanaugh, I withhold judgment until credibility of allegations can be weighed.   Leftist hypocrisy is on display.
466<||>Male<||>@GrrrGraphics I say we do to Mueller what the left did to Kavanugh. Eye for an eye. Guilty until proven innocent as revenge. #BelieveWomen #MeToo
467<||>Female<||>@AstorGoodwin How dare Dump, or any of his minions, try to use #MeToo to stop this investigation. It\u2019s disgusting!
468<||>Male<||>ery sad but not shocking. \"The research shows that white evangelical Protestants are at odds with all other identified religious groups on many questions relating to immigration, race, the #MeToo movement and President Donald Trump.\" https://t.co/zPM8gzWAA6
469<||>Male<||>@NPR Huh, isn't this what the @GOP and other conservatives accuse #MeToo of doing? The way this horrible version of the Republican Party projects is absolutely fascinating and terrifying. What a sham.
470<||>Female<||>@annavetticad These woke men, of course. Rely on them to tell us where #MeToo should be restricted and where not. They put domestic violence and failed relationships in the same line. And they are soooo woke, boi.
471<||>Male<||>Could be just me, it seems more dangerous than ever attempting to bribe any woman to lie about this matter after #MeToo and #BelieveWomen.  Not that it was ever right, wise, or recommended.
472<||>Female<||>Why #CSR matters more than ever in the age of #MeToo. https://t.co/tTJvnSQyMx by @patsydoerr
473<||>Male<||>I for one believe all women which is why i will believe this Mueller accuser until it is proven she is or isn't lying. Sure is odd All the media is trying to get out in front of this before we even have the accuser's name though for those noting.. #Metoo
474<||>Female<||>\"What is misleading is that people say #MeToo is an urban elite thing that must reach the poor. It's actually the other way around.\" Meet Bhanwari Devi, who is being called the \"mother\" of India's #MeToo movement. #lighttheway #itsherturn https://t.co/fr5UTZVxcp https://t.co/Je3IPPyVbO
475<||>Female<||>@RogueNASA Except they actually know Kavanaugh allegations were true, they just see no downside of weaponizing #metoo if it works Mueller is discredited and they have grounds to fire him. If it fails they can say, \"look women DO makeup allegations to harm innocent men!\
476<||>Female<||>The new #MeToomvmt commercial put me to tears. If anything has ever happened to you, even if someone else has told you it \u201cwasn\u2019t that bad\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d, or belittled your trauma, I am here. I am always an open ear. Please don\u2019t hesitate.  #metoo

480<||>Female<||>#MeToo is not enough. We need to go out against #patriarchy, #misogyny and other abuse of women. Stop protecting #religion, tradition and \"culture\". #migration  #freedom #equality #atheist #secular
