I was 20, when my editor forced me to go Goa with him. When asked, if it is a team outing, he replied who needs more people when its me and him. When I said no, he kept on asking me &amp; said he ll book everything. As if money was a deal breaker.  #MeToo.
@ACLUNV  Woman's Encampment: The government won't be able to stop Women from having abortions in the \"Woman's Encampments\".Peace. EVERY TIME @AroonDeep tweeted something about #MeToo I wanted to SCREAM because I've known this for years. Fuck you man, you really let all of us down. My previous tweets referring to \"male juniors\" was mostly about him and some others. https://t.co/dNM27SsTE9.
If the accuser names herself, you say she's doing it for attention. If the accuser stays anonymous,you question her authenticity. The identity of the accuser is not relevant. That she chose to identify her abuser publicly is! Courage &amp; closure supercede all else. #TimesUp #MeToo.
I am not at all surprised that Suhel Seth's name has come up in the #MeToo conversation. For years he has preyed on young women, and the whisper network was ripe with stories of his depravity. I was 26 when he publicly harassed and humiliated me. No one stopped him. @MasalaBai.
Last night at the Trump rally in PA, a liberal protester touched me against my consent and said he'd throw me on the ground and rape me. Feminists around him, who say we're supposed to believe women, defended him and denied it happened. This is what the left has come to. #MeToo https://t.co/E6R9c0LA9J.
If someone was sleeping till 10 or more years and all of sudden she  comeout saying #metoo  Its a complete faliure of system if they are being entertained.  it will increase more #falseallegations #fakecases #TanushreeDutta #NanaPatekar #MeToo4publicity.
Some women (read Ablanari) took sleeping pills 10-20 yrs back, and suddenly woke up seeing an opportunity in #MeToo movement 2 earn name &amp; fame just by shaming some high profilers, whilst using #MeToo4publicity which will lead 2 earn free moolah. @republic @Manekagandhibjp https://t.co/a8EUpRdisd.
As I cry and succumb to mental exhaustion because of #MeToo\u2060 \u2060, I remember the friendships women forged and solidarity we showered upon each other. Each one of you who has helped, supported, fought the war, been there relentlessly - I will never forget.  Thank you. I love you.
#MeToo has been elite, privileged, certainly not representative, and importantly, restricted to those who have access to this platform.We need to talk about this.  Can we do so without discrediting this wave? Without invalidating the struggles of those who have spoken up?.
First hand account of a survivor from @TeachForIndia. @heauxbaton publicly talks about her internship at TFI and the sexual harassment and abuse she faced. More power to you Poulomi #MeToo #TimesUp https://t.co/5hOhvGX9gf.
IMPORTANT : My DMs are open. Let's hear #HimToo #MenToo and the #MeToo stories of Men. Tell me about cases where you as a man or a man you know has been abused, sexually assaulted, harassed, intimidated, falsely accused and not even heard let alone believed. REACH OUT &amp; RT.
One year ago I recorded this for my daughter, explaining why I shared my story of sexual assault. I never expected to release it publicly. Now, I feel it\u2019s too important not to share. #MeToo  Dear Elizabella, I love you so. I will fight so you don\u2019t have to. Love, mama https://t.co/TYk5XXFksY.
An abusive relationship, however bad, is not #metoo. An affair gone bad is not #metoo. A man trying to flirt with you is not #metoo. A consensual relationship that fetched you benefits at one time is not #metoo in retrospect. Please don't dilute the movement.
I admire the courage of @priyaramani &amp; all the victims who spoke out against sexual harassment &amp; abuse. @mjakbar s resignation is a moral victory for everyone. The defamation case can\u2019t change that. The #MeToo movement needs support across party lines. https://t.co/I5hXnCKwMS.
@FoxNews we DEMAND you cover the sex scandal unfolding within  NJ Governor Phil Murphy\u2019s administration. In the era of #MeToo, and given the horrific treatment of SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh over uncorroborated claims of sex assault, the case of #katiebrennan merits attention!.
#MeToo #MeTooIndia #MeTooControversy #MeToo4Publicity   Take that .... This Me too is a well orchestrated Feminist Propaganda...  It is clearly used to create a divide in families destroy the cultural fabric of family values https://t.co/ERKULzlpqm.

The #MeToo movement is officially dead.   The left only cares about women's sexual assault allegations when it is against a rival political party.  They NEVER cared about the claims of the victims!  #ThesePeopleAreSick #HypocriticalLeft #VoteDemsOut #PedoWood #RapeIsntAJoke https://t.co/tkhR2ssXaK
This is horrifying, sexist, and unacceptable. \"On Monday morning, an Ontario Catholic school principal and vice-principal walked into a Grade 12 classroom and asked the girls to stand up to check their skirt lengths as the boys watched.\"  https://t.co/mLTJnmIKMg #metoo
#Metoo dies a little more everyday. Bryan Singer is back at work. Woody Allen is getting support. James Gunn is back at work. Harvey Weinstein is pretty much on the verge of being cleared of any charges. CeeLo Green is back on the voice. America really doesn't care about rape.
#MeToo movement will ensure that the future generations are protected. What happened with us won't happen to them. All men aren't devils &amp; all women aren't victims. Every case of must be investigated objectively: #LokmatWomanSummit #Insights @MiLOKMAT https://t.co/ug0TKZkOl4

For ladies in #Gambia.   I\u2019m working on a series of survivor stories within the context of #MeToo, told exactly as the survivors would choose. If you\u2019re a survivor or know someone who is comfortable with it, and would want to share their story, please DM me.

@HBO it's also not ok to abuse, threaten &amp; attempt to quell those speaking out against this abhorrent behaviour, which sees your actors promoting sexual misconduct, and the humanisation of traffickers and predatory behaviour under the guise of art and media #metoo #timesup
A student of the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, complained about sexual harassment and now the professor is back without any consequence  A report earlier this year.   https://t.co/KDSJwpIH7B  I'll follow it up with the survivor's statement soon #MeToo #MeTooIndia
\u2018Mechanisms need to exist for freelance journalists to be able to report sexual abuse and misconduct. Women should feel safe to report it. It\u2019s doable and can be done, but I don\u2019t see that happening.\u2019 - @kristenchick @frontlineclub #MeToo #Photojournalism
When people talk about #metoo coming to other countries, don't forget that South Asian sex workers, mostly women, have been leading the struggle for sex worker rights globally. For decades. Standing up to violence, thuggery in Bangladesh and India. For decades. https://t.co/2h28cTBfTv
The #MeToo movement must not die an early death just after creating a few sparks here and there. It must spread like wildfire across our patriarchal society and institutions.  It ought to reflect the multidimensional oppression and discrimination women face  everywhere. https://t.co/L3eKd8HLdl
As awakened and socially courageous group of people, it is our duty to speak up for young Rajalakshmi who lost her life calling out her abuser and saying #MeToo. Let us say, #TimesUp to a casteist power abusing social environment. #VoicesFromTheMargins #DalitLivesMatter https://t.co/J499j81Ooi
Any feminist lawyers out there want to join forces and learn cutting edge defamation law so we can protect people who speak out in the #metoo movement? I\u2019m in Vancouver and want to join a collective to level the playing field!
"One of the best commentaries on #MeToo Convicting a person without sufficient proof is a bigger crime than not convicting a criminal. Because the number of innocent people affected potentially becomes much bigger \"social bomb\" than the number of criminals. https://t.co/kiSFgHoWrr
he registry only catches 3% of sex offenders. Even then, less than 50% are even accurately registered.   The other 97% are largely unknown to anyone but their victims.   #metoo #churchtoo #CSA https://t.co/PMblb2W8OZ

#Metoo shudn't be abt sympathy for others stories alone; it shud enable moments for our own self reflection. Everytime we kept quiet when we saw someone else being bullied n harassed becoz of our own selfish interests. #Metoo shud truly be an account of our own complicity too!

This fight for justice has taken so much from us. I am heartbroken today. Or just broken. The people our families choose to surround themselves with, when they could have us, breaks me inside.  All because she spoke. #allbecauseshespoke #metoo #JusticeForJulianna
\"The Swedish Academy is in such disarray that it could not give out a Nobel Prize in Literature this year....and...at no point has the Swedish Academy itself admitted the validity of the underlying #MeToo grievances, taken responsibility, or apologized.\" @lesley_wexler
#DearWorld: It\u2019s time to go beyond denouncing individual abusers. We also need to reform the institutions and systems that shelter them from consequences while punishing women who speak out. Let\u2019s get moving. #metoo https://t.co/yxWCxRNWFX https://t.co/cudVfyhupJ
A long term solution would be the exact opposite of the two suggested here \u2013 gender sensitisation, not segregation so that the idea of exchange between different genders is normalised instead of being stigmatised further. #MeToo #Gender https://t.co/bEIPdhYqEF
There was a recent study that said that 75% of female physicians have been sexually harassed (or worse) by patients. I was surprised that the figure wasn\u2019t higher. I first witnessed it on day 3 of my first third year rotation as a medical student. #MeToo  https://t.co/hSPVduDt1i
There is just a fine-line between being a victim and being a fighter.But,when you break that fine-line,there comes a transformational change and your experience becomes transcendental.The choice is yours, whether you choose to live as a victim or as a fighter. #MeTooNepal #MeToo
@ScottMStedman @JacobAWohl is letting the cat out of the bag that the @GOP plans on trying a #MeToo scandal on #RobertMueller.Hoping the media and the left will fall for it considering the right could give two #BrettKavanaugh shits about sexual assault.

Of course. The natural progression of labeling women who come forward with credible claims of assault against your allies as lying sluts is to weaponize #metoo against your enemies. They think it\u2019s a huge \u201cgotcha\u201d. Please prove them wrong. https://t.co/a2OGhcHnYb
