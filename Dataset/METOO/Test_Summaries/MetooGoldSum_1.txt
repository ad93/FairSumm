If a guy says he's nervous about #MeToo, just remind him that we come down pretty hard on murderers too, and ask him why that doesn't make him nervous. If he says, \"Because I haven't murdered anyone,\" then you've learned something new about your friend.
Let's talk about absolute hypocrisy!  The left has stood by while these three have done their dirt!   Where's the outrage?!   Way to highjack #MeToo movement for political gain. Sad! https://t.co/ttMnUF8meD.
I was 20, when my editor forced me to go Goa with him. When asked, if it is a team outing, he replied who needs more people when its me and him. When I said no, he kept on asking me &amp; said he ll book everything. As if money was a deal breaker.  #MeToo.
The left has hyjacked the #metoo movement. The left does not believe in innocent until proven guilty. The left does not believe in America first instead they would rather put every country ahead of the United States.
@rohini_sgh everyone now knows that there are #MolestersatWire you should come out and share your experience. We would to hear/read your stories. #MeToo.
If the accuser names herself, you say she's doing it for attention. If the accuser stays anonymous,you question her authenticity. The identity of the accuser is not relevant. That she chose to identify her abuser publicly is! Courage &amp; closure supercede all else. #TimesUp #MeToo.
Last night at the Trump rally in PA, a liberal protester touched me against my consent and said he'd throw me on the ground and rape me. Feminists around him, who say we're supposed to believe women, defended him and denied it happened. This is what the left has come to. #MeToo https://t.co/E6R9c0LA9J.
Asrani on #MeToo Movement: All this is Rubbish and Lie for Publicity  Lo JI Ho gaya Banta Dhar   everybody knows its a publicity stunt #Metoo4publicity  #SpeakUpMan   @vivekagnihotri  @suhelseth  @DrGPradhan  @SimplySajidK  @swarup1972   https://t.co/w9kYSkKlrb.
#MeToo4Publicity  The #GenderBiasedLaws  were pushing men to commit suicide. #MeToo is adding fuel to the fire ! #Mangina  in firing line of #FeministMafia.
people who couldn't find work in industry &amp; no money to survive are looking for old lockers &amp; files to find a fictional story, so that they make a comeback in https://t.co/HkCOfvY8Jw see only #MeToo4Publicity drive people for #MeTooIndia  #metoo https://t.co/f5Gc1khqAJ.
#MeToo has been elite, privileged, certainly not representative, and importantly, restricted to those who have access to this platform.  We need to talk about this.  Can we do so without discrediting this wave? Without invalidating the struggles of those who have spoken up?.
@MinistryWCD @Manekagandhibjp It's an excellent example of hypocrisy by Govt, when innocent men's where roped in #fakecases fake #498a which lead them to #suicide there wasn't anyone to come in support,  but when opportunistic like #TanushreeDutta stepped in then committee was formed  #MeToo4Publicity #MeToo https://t.co/rgLJMQ439H.
IMPORTANT : My DMs are open. Let's hear #HimToo #MenToo and the #MeToo stories of Men. Tell me about cases where you as a man or a man you know has been abused, sexually assaulted, harassed, intimidated, falsely accused and not even heard let alone believed. REACH OUT &amp; RT.
Pain knows no gender. When it hurts, it hurts equally, weather its a man or woman. Why there is discrimination on Gender. Every person deserves dignified treatment and happy life.\" #MeToo  #MeToo4Publicity  #PurushAayog  #PindadaanOfWives https://t.co/8vBqjfO5EA.
An abusive relationship, however bad, is not #metoo. An affair gone bad is not #metoo. A man trying to flirt with you is not #metoo. A consensual relationship that fetched you benefits at one time is not #metoo in retrospect. Please don't dilute the movement.
@SenatorCollins Too bad you don't really believe in the power of truth. How can you live with yourself, knowingly voting for an alcoholic abuser of women. Next time I am sexually assaulted I will first ask if anyone would like to witness for prosperity's sake #metoo screw you.
@FoxNews we DEMAND you cover the sex scandal unfolding within  NJ Governor Phil Murphy\u2019s administration. In the era of #MeToo, and given the horrific treatment of SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh over uncorroborated claims of sex assault, the case of #katiebrennan merits attention!.
This fight for justice has taken so much from us. I am heartbroken today. Or just broken. The people our families choose to surround themselves with, when they could have us, breaks me inside.  All because she spoke. #allbecauseshespoke #metoo #JusticeForJulianna
#MeToo #MeTooIndia #MeTooControversy #MeToo4Publicity   Take that .... This Me too is a well orchestrated Feminist Propaganda...  It is clearly used to create a divide in families destroy the cultural fabric of family values https://t.co/ERKULzlpqm.
ONLY 40 charges and thousands of cries for help. Too many are victim to #UberRape and their voices aren't being heard. #TimesUp #Metoo https://t.co/RBcFYQ8VRW
I\u2019m so fucking stupid everyone always says don\u2019t get in a stranger\u2019s car. I\u2019m fucking smarter than this. I hate this world you can never trust anyone\ud83e\udd2eI\u2019m fine, he just tried to hold my hand, put his hand on my leg. I got home safely but still... he was 60 and I\u2019m 17 #metoo
\u201cIf a woman is unveiled it gives a man the right 2 demand sexual favors\u201d.When it comes 2 sexual harassment in Islamic Republic it is always your fault if U don\u2019t wear hijab. Women using camera to expose sexual harassment. #MyCameraIsMyWeapon is like  #MeToo\u2060 \u2060 movement in Iran.
She has no cellphone and doesn't use hashtags. \"What is misleading is that people say #MeToo is an urban elite thing that must reach the poor. It's actually the other way around.\" 'They Deserve Justice': Mother Of India's #MeToo Speaks Out https://t.co/ptfAYCIOVv
The #MeToo movement is officially dead.   The left only cares about women's sexual assault allegations when it is against a rival political party.  They NEVER cared about the claims of the victims!  #ThesePeopleAreSick #HypocriticalLeft #VoteDemsOut #PedoWood #RapeIsntAJoke https://t.co/tkhR2ssXaK
This is the most important piece I've ever written. \"For the most part, mainstream media and so-called LGBT organizations have chosen to ignore a specific demographic of the #MeToo movement.
#ArjunSarja has announced he will sue the lady for #metoo allegations. This should be done by every man who has been accused and if they are genuinely affected by false allegations. Just because u have a hashtag u can't do character assassination
Don't get fooled by #MeToo gang . #SpeakUpMan to Stop  #MeToo4Publicity  https://t.co/7OFBeCFJC0 Don't get fooled by #MeToo gang . #SpeakUpMan to Stop abuse of Men and Demand Gender Neutral law. If Women do not do such crime , why they afraid for Gender neutral Law?
#MeToo Pls empower the children in your houses to speak up. Let us discuss the evil in society if we want to tackle them! Increase collective awareness and reduce chances of fatalities. Better policies - At work, home, schools, Panchayat offices! #TimesUp #JusticeForRajalakshmi
If a woman shares a #metoo without evidence, it's taken to be true coz it's a women's testimony, a man coming out with #HeToo story, people would be doubtful,  &amp; question the evidences, the intent &amp; will never except the man as victim. #misandry must be understood. #SpeakUpMan https://t.co/FMJoz2gH3Z
#MeToo movement will ensure that the future generations are protected. What happened with us won't happen to them. All men aren't devils &amp; all women aren't victims. Every case of must be investigated objectively: #LokmatWomanSummit #Insights @MiLOKMAT https://t.co/ug0TKZkOl4
Since my #metoo moment:  * Someone tried to unsuccessfully shut down my Shopify stores. * Someone unsuccessfully reported my herbal business to Health Canada. *One abuser had a lawyer unsuccessfully send me a threatening cease &amp; desist letter. * Someone hacked my FB &amp; messages.
Does having more #women #friendly police stations matter for reporting crime against a woman?  Does a friendly face matter? @UConn yes!!! - women report more domestic violence, kidnappings when there are women police officers around. #MeTooIndia #MeToo #NEUDC2018 @CornellDyson https://t.co/KplRz50ILH
I'm not finding any form of condemnation from #MeToo campaigners for the predator who beheaded the 13year old girl.  #MeToo is silenced for #Rajalakshmi This is Caste bigotry.   #JusticeForRajalakshmi  #TamilNadu
If these same signs had pictures of transgender African Americans holding #metoo signs, there would be rioting, looting, and protests. The right would be called white supremacists and nazis for it. The double standard is real and easy to see. https://t.co/7QtTqsdPY8
Nearly 25 years have passed since a  woman who was raped in Prospect Park was smeared as a liar. Now, after the rise of #meToo , she's getting a full, unequivocal apology from New York City's police commissioner. https://t.co/1wn3gSdzZ8
Dear #feminists of India, see this.  #MeToo #MeTooIndia #MeTooControversy #MeToo4Publicity   #Police and Judiciary must watch this because no media will show you this and make it popular. #feminist and biased society must change their biased mentality.  #MenToo #HeToo https://t.co/7MYtpopqbS
Woman assaulted security guard &amp; put the blame on him. Policeman visited the lobby of the housing society. The women went out of control and stripped in front on policemen and security guard to run away from the situation. #MeghaSharma #HimToo #MeToo https://t.co/4jhHQfUHc4
I heard @timesofindia is calling all women to come forward &amp; share their #MeToo stories. One question. Is it another brand building? What are you doing with the #MeToo  within your organisation? 3 women dared to speak up against @satadruojhaTOI what did you do @vineetjaintimes ?
As awakened and socially courageous group of people, it is our duty to speak up for young Rajalakshmi who lost her life calling out her abuser and saying #MeToo. Let us say, #TimesUp to a casteist power abusing social environment. #VoicesFromTheMargins #DalitLivesMatter https://t.co/J499j81Ooi
Respect females, not because they deserve. ,Do it because your single mistake (according to her) will ruin your life totally, after that social media , women's commission, aliens all would be against you. #MeghaSharma #MeTooIndia #MeToo #MeTooControversy
"One of the best commentaries on #MeToo Convicting a person without sufficient proof is a bigger crime than not convicting a criminal. Because the number of innocent people affected potentially becomes much bigger \"social bomb\" than the number of criminals. https://t.co/kiSFgHoWrr
The registry only catches 3% of sex offenders. Even then, less than 50% are even accurately registered.   The other 97% are largely unknown to anyone but their victims.   #metoo #churchtoo #CSA https://t.co/PMblb2W8OZ

@HillaryClinton Trump is right; a vote for Republicans on November 6th is a vote for him. It\u2019s a vote against women, a vote against freedom of speech, a vote for racism, a vote for hate crimes, a vote for acceptance of his lies. #MeToo #JamalKhashoggi #MAGABomber #PittsburghSynagogueShooting
#Metoo shudn't be abt sympathy for others stories alone; it shud enable moments for our own self reflection. Everytime we kept quiet when we saw someone else being bullied n harassed becoz of our own selfish interests. #Metoo shud truly be an account of our own complicity too!

A long term solution would be the exact opposite of the two suggested here \u2013 gender sensitisation, not segregation so that the idea of exchange between different genders is normalised instead of being stigmatised further. #MeToo #Gender https://t.co/bEIPdhYqEF
Very sensible perspective: Both men &amp; women are people.  Some people behave badly, some don't. #NotAllMen are bad. Not all women are good. Who would have guessed?  #GenderEquality #MeToo #MenToo #ToxicFemininity #ToxicMasculinity #BelieveWomen https://t.co/bT6g34SYWK
#metoo has redefined feminism in India but lacking of legal processes is making this moment mere gossipy. Instead proper investigation should be carried out to sort out the truth behind such allegations. It will also not discourage those women who dared to speak the truth.
