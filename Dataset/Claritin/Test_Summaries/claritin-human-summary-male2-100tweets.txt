I guess I'm gonna have to get Claritin D because these other medicines are not working
If she has seasonal allergies, she wants the Claritin D.

Nurse's: Allegra, Claritin, or Zyrtec? They all have different ingredients. What's best?
Claritin and cough suppresant I hope this will do. I been barking ( coughing) for two days
If she's sick, give her the Claritin D
Ew Claritin tastes so bad
I need some claritin asap.
I could really use some Claritin right now.
Anyone know if you can take Claritin and Benadryl at the same time? I can't breathe and the Claritin isn't cutting it alone.
Allergy attack on the train, anyone have any claritin D or nasonex? #goingtobealongday #helpme #4train
@Selkie1970 @beckshorter I am on Claritin basically year round. Might be helping by not having it be worse.
Today is just going to be fantastic... Woke up late, didn't take my Claritin last night... #yaythursday
My mom said I was grounded because I'm threatening to overdose on Claritin.
I just want to be Claritin clear.
For some reason, I woke up this morning enthusiastic about social media. It's been a while. Maybe it's that Claritin-D that I took.
I need a Claritin so badly!!!
Does Claritin work?
Not even Claritin will be able to help these allergies. #siiiick
If she has allergies ....she probably wants that claritin D.
I need some Claritin or something this runny nose is getting old
I really need more than one Claritin today
Someone must have slipped him some claritin
claritin-d works miracles
i hate allergies and i also hate claritin for not working
Oh Claritin...you're my only friend.

Claritin didn't work -.-
Done! Now a shower and Claritin! My nose is on FIRE!
This that bullshit. I'm going to find some claritin tah-day.
And what's worse is that I reached my 3-day limit on the nose spray yesterday, which means I have to rely on Claritin.
Actually, upon further research, it seems that Claritin does absolutely nothing for colds. So, I'm pretty much fucked.
Taking Benadryl and Claritin has became an everyday thing for me.. #allergiessuck
Te rest of my night will consist of watching ghost adventures, taking Claritin, and sleeping. #life #of #a #sleepy #sick #girl
My allergies are so bad i just listened to my claritin kick in. #michiganissues
Want to wake up to Claritin, Halls, orange juice and pancakes.
Forgot to take my Claritin
Ahhh I need claritin
Taking a chance and thinking it might be allergies causing the headache.  Claritin, don't fail me now.
Gonna be a Claritin clear weekend... #allergies
Woke up with a helluva headache. 4 Advil, 1 Claritin and 3 cups of strong coffee later, I've decided to just sleep it off. #allergies
Haven't been able to sleep. My nose is so stuffy. Claritin, theraflu and benadryl did not help. Any suggestions? I'm soo tired
Hello Claritin

Taking some Claritin ... Hope this will help.
Allergies are going crazy! Arghhhhhhh make it stop. Need Claritin or a punch in the face.

To whoever took all my ibuprofen and Claritin, you are rude. Please replace.
I love Claritin D. #plantsstophavingsex #allergies

Claritin and Flonase are my new found friends.
I keep forgetting to take my Claritin :/

When your mate buys you Claritin and keeps it in her cupboard for when you visit.... #kittenalergy #topmate
I've used Claritin all my life and it finally stopped working. Who gets drowsy with Zyrtec?
Anyone have any Claritin D ? I'm dying slowly with this runny nose.
Is it possible to overdose on Claritin? These allergies are not my friends.
I wonder what would happen if I give my dog a claritin... Old man can't stop sneezing
For Claritin to be as costly as it is, you'd think it would actually work?!
I jus took a Claritin. I been sick all Day

@ChandlerHead @courtneyclark24 @heyitsmollls GET CLARITIN CLEAR
If they are asking for Allegra, Mucinex, or Claritin.. they want the D. _â€™â€_â€™Âç_
I hope this Claritin helps
@Mike_Ali9 @laloveit As long as the Claritin counter-balanced it, then a-ok by me. Sacrifices had to be made..
@sawngbyrd28 Yes you can overdose on Claritin.  Any signs of muscle contractions, drowsiness, or headache?
Considering building a swipe access medicine cabinet in the baker center with Claritin-D and Pepto and cough drops and Motrin and Listerine.
I've been having Claritin for like months and I just noticed that it's expired 2 years. http://t.co/LcqfWtux
I just took a claritin that expired six years ago. Out of sheer desperation. May the odds be ever in my favor
Did u know that the cost of claritin is not eligible for reimbursement with flex spending $ but transgender surgery costs are.
I'm poppin claritin like m&amp;m's an I still can't breathe #true #allergies #santagato
Just watched a guy at the pharmacy get turned down for Claritin-D because he said he had "the symptoms" when asked why he was buying it.
