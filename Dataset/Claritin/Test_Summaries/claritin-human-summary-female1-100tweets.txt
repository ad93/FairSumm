Give her the Claritin D
I need Claritin
My breakfast: a bowl of honey nut cherios,a glass of apple juice,and 2 tab of Claritin clear non drowsy! #GoodMorningAllergies! -_-'
If she says she's sick, she totally wants the Claritin D.
If she has seasonal allergies, she wants the Claritin D.
Claritin-D is AMAZING more so than regular Claritin!
My mom just gave me Claritin for my "allergies" ;)
Claritin D
Claritin liqui gels saved me today&gt;&gt;
My sneezing has reached epic volume levels. Thank goodness I didn't throw away the Claritin.
I took Claritin for the first time, and just took a 2 hour nap. I think they need to remove the part that says NON-DROWSY!
Tea, claritin, and cough drops have been my best friends the past few days.
She was sick so I gave her the D, Claritin D
End of Day 2: Cracked and bought some Claritin-D, the world is infinitely clearer and brighter and much less miserable. Recovery is possible
Claritin Clear.
I hate my allergies! Claritin  is my bestfriend now!
I feel like the before shot of the Claritin commercials where they lift up the seemingly invisible film and its much clearer.
I was tired and had a headache. Then I took a Claritin and now I'm really tired but don't have a sinus headache. I just want to be healthy.
I can breathe today! Claritin and Benadryl, you are my best friends!
My mother in law is awesome! She bought me Claritin! I pray this is the perfect remedy.
Nurse's: Allegra, Claritin, or Zyrtec? They all have different ingredients. What's best?
Claritin and cough suppresant I hope this will do. I been barking ( coughing) for two days
If she's sick, give her the Claritin D
Ew Claritin tastes so bad
not sure why but I'm having an extreme allergic reaction to something. Benadryl or claritin?
I could really use some Claritin right now.
Anyone know if you can take Claritin and Benadryl at the same time? I can't breathe and the Claritin isn't cutting it alone.
Allergy attack on the train, anyone have any claritin D or nasonex? #goingtobealongday #helpme #4train
God bless the makers of Claritin.
Today is just going to be fantastic... Woke up late, didn't take my Claritin last night... #yaythursday
My mom said I was grounded because I'm threatening to overdose on Claritin.
I just want to be Claritin clear.
For some reason, I woke up this morning enthusiastic about social media. It's been a while. Maybe it's that Claritin-D that I took.
I need a Claritin so badly!!!
Does Claritin work?
Not even Claritin will be able to help these allergies. #siiiick
If she has allergies ....she probably wants that claritin D.
I need some Claritin or something this runny nose is getting old
I really need more than one Claritin today
Someone must have slipped him some claritin
claritin-d works miracles
i hate allergies and i also hate claritin for not working
Oh Claritin...you're my only friend.
living life claritin clear
Claritin didn't work -.-
Done! Now a shower and Claritin! My nose is on FIRE!
Claritin is my savior!
And what's worse is that I reached my 3-day limit on the nose spray yesterday, which means I have to rely on Claritin.
I hate that Claritin is a 24-hour medicine. It obviously doesn't work, at least on me anyway.
Taking Benadryl and Claritin has became an everyday thing for me.. #allergiessuck
Te rest of my night will consist of watching ghost adventures, taking Claritin, and sleeping. #life #of #a #sleepy #sick #girl
forgot my claritin now I'm gonna die
Want to wake up to Claritin, Halls, orange juice and pancakes.
Forgot to take my Claritin
Ahhh I need claritin
Taking a chance and thinking it might be allergies causing the headache.  Claritin, don't fail me now.
Gonna be a Claritin clear weekend... #allergies
Woke up with a helluva headache. 4 Advil, 1 Claritin and 3 cups of strong coffee later, I've decided to just sleep it off. #allergies
Claritin-D + Mucinex seems to be working better than anything so far, still feel miserable.
Hello Claritin
just took some Claritin. my allergies got everything itching
Taking some Claritin ... Hope this will help.
Allergies are going crazy! Arghhhhhhh make it stop. Need Claritin or a punch in the face.
Feeling great after Claritin! Today is going great* God Bless*
I need claritin
To whoever took all my ibuprofen and Claritin, you are rude. Please replace.
I love Claritin D. #plantsstophavingsex #allergies
Went to the doctor...told him i had headaches and body aches...he gives me claritin -_-
Been taking Claritin all day and my allergies still messing with me
You need to take a Claritin or something. You sound congested
finally took my allergy medicine and now i live life Claritin clear!
Claritin and Flonase are my new found friends.
I keep forgetting to take my Claritin :/
Just took this Claritin... No snoring for me tonight lol.
Thank you Claritin and Mucenix.
When your mate buys you Claritin and keeps it in her cupboard for when you visit.... #kittenalergy #topmate
I've used Claritin all my life and it finally stopped working. Who gets drowsy with Zyrtec?
Anyone have any Claritin D ? I'm dying slowly with this runny nose.
Is it possible to overdose on Claritin? These allergies are not my friends.
I wonder what would happen if I give my dog a claritin... Old man can't stop sneezing
For Claritin to be as costly as it is, you'd think it would actually work?!
yeah i totally want the d, the claritin d, that is. it's allergy season.
I'm sick.  And I want the Claritin D
If she sneeze's , give her claritin D.
10:15 needs to hurry up so I can take this last Claritin.
Claritin doesn't even work....
They don't work boy.I must be need Nyquil or Claritin.
Just gave my dog a Claritin.. I think I need one also
My allergies acting up today....I need my claritin
Claritin always fails me. I need Benadryl to survive.
Taking a Claritin and going to bed. Feeling horrible again.
if a claritin a day could really keep the sneezing away, i would be a much happier camper.
Claritin is my friend tonight
Ohhhh I forgot to take Claritin this morning #sorryforsneezing
