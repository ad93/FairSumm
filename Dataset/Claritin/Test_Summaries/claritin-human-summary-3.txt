@Princess_Tayyyy @sheewantsyourd hahaha I just thought of one! If she has allergies, give her Claritin D!
My breakfast: a bowl of honey nut cherios,a glass of apple juice,and 2 tab of Claritin clear non drowsy! #GoodMorningAllergies! -_-'
I guess I'm gonna have to get Claritin D because these other medicines are not working
If she has seasonal allergies, she wants the Claritin D.
@tarablakex33 "@speck_C_C is tara sick? You should give her the claritin d"
My nose is stopped up, my head hurts , my eyes are red and puffy and I don't have anymore Claritin _‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_‰ÛªÌâ_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_‰ÛªÌâ_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_‰ÛªÌâ help me
If she's sick, give her the Claritin D!
Claritin liqui gels saved me today&gt;&gt;
My sneezing has reached epic volume levels. Thank goodness I didn't throw away the Claritin.
I've been taking claritin on and off for over 5 months now; wtf is wrong with me and my crappy lungs
If she has allergies... Give her the Claritin- "D"
I'm fairly sure that this Claritin-D I've been taking is only perpetuating my allergies #Imoverit
I don't know why i insist on having allergies all day when I can just take a claritin
Claritin Clear.
@shea_standefer  try non-drowsy forumla Claritin, Benadryl, Sudaphed, Allegra, Loratidine, etc.
"@DuhSheWantsTheD: If she sneezes, give her some claritin D." #fuckingawesome
I was tired and had a headache. Then I took a Claritin and now I'm really tired but don't have a sinus headache. I just want to be healthy.
@ECFrost Cough drops.  Green tea.  Claritin and advil.  the first two will help clear it up; other 2 make you functional
@JonathanRKnight i'm a doc and i take Allegra. But Zyrtec works well too. Claritin never did much for me.
Nurse's: Allegra, Claritin, or Zyrtec? They all have different ingredients. What's best?
Claritin and cough suppresant I hope this will do. I been barking ( coughing) for two days
If she's sick, give her the Claritin D
Ew Claritin tastes so bad
I need some claritin asap.
I could really use some Claritin right now.
Anyone know if you can take Claritin and Benadryl at the same time? I can't breathe and the Claritin isn't cutting it alone.
Allergy attack on the train, anyone have any claritin D or nasonex? #goingtobealongday #helpme #4train
@Selkie1970 @beckshorter I am on Claritin basically year round. Might be helping by not having it be worse.
Today is just going to be fantastic... Woke up late, didn't take my Claritin last night... #yaythursday
My mom said I was grounded because I'm threatening to overdose on Claritin.
I just want to be Claritin clear.
For some reason, I woke up this morning enthusiastic about social media. It's been a while. Maybe it's that Claritin-D that I took.
I need a Claritin so badly!!!
Does Claritin work?
Not even Claritin will be able to help these allergies. #siiiick
If she has allergies ....she probably wants that claritin D.
I need some Claritin or something this runny nose is getting old
I really need more than one Claritin today
She wants the Claritin, D. http://t.co/5LjLA2yi
@brittniaustin Claritin is not a decongestant; it's an antihistamine. You need to use Afrin nasal spray gel with the pump mister.
i hate allergies and i also hate claritin for not working
Oh Claritin...you're my only friend.
Claritin didn't work -.-
STFU RT @daniellyyss: Juliana has allergies, maybe andres can give her some Claritin D  HAHAHAHAAAAAAAA
Done! Now a shower and Claritin! My nose is on FIRE!
This that bullshit. I'm going to find some claritin tah-day.
Actually, upon further research, it seems that Claritin does absolutely nothing for colds. So, I'm pretty much fucked.
I LOVE @Zedd 's new album #Claritin ! It clears up ALL of my allergy related problems!
I'm on life support... #Claritin
If a girl texts you "Heyy I'm sick" she probably wants the D , CLARITIN D ;) #LOL #DYING #HALARIOUS #HAHAHA _‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_Ê‰ÛÓÌ¤_‰Ûª‰Û_‰ÛªÌÛ‰ÛªÌ¢‰Ûª_‰ÛªÕ‰ÛªÌ¢ #goooodnight.

Taking a chance and thinking it might be allergies causing the headache.  Claritin, don't fail me now.

Woke up with a helluva headache. 4 Advil, 1 Claritin and 3 cups of strong coffee later, I've decided to just sleep it off. #allergies
Haven't been able to sleep. My nose is so stuffy. Claritin, theraflu and benadryl did not help. Any suggestions? I'm soo tired
Hello Claritin

"@The_Wise_Man_: If a girl texts you saying she's sick, clearly she wants the D... Claritin-D." @Jemma_Garrettx. This is definitely you.

Thank you Claritin and Mucenix.
When your mate buys you Claritin and keeps it in her cupboard for when you visit.... #kittenalergy #topmate
I've used Claritin all my life and it finally stopped working. Who gets drowsy with Zyrtec?
Protip: Claritin dosage: RT @JRGarcia: @theneener I‰Ûª_‰Ûª_Ì__ve heard treating it as a suppository works fastest.
Is it possible to overdose on Claritin? These allergies are not my friends.
I wonder what would happen if I give my dog a claritin... Old man can't stop sneezing
If a girl sends you the text: Heyy im sick. She wants the Claritin D #ithinkimfunny #HonestHour #FOLLOWME #TheRoyaals

@sawngbyrd28 Yes you can overdose on Claritin.  Any signs of muscle contractions, drowsiness, or headache?
Considering building a swipe access medicine cabinet in the baker center with Claritin-D and Pepto and cough drops and Motrin and Listerine.
I've been having Claritin for like months and I just noticed that it's expired 2 years. http://t.co/LcqfWtux
I just took a claritin that expired six years ago. Out of sheer desperation. May the odds be ever in my favor
Did u know that the cost of claritin is not eligible for reimbursement with flex spending $ but transgender surgery costs are.
"@Intinz: If she has allergies, Then give her the Claritin D_‰Ûª‰Û_‰Ûª_‰ÛªÕ"
Just watched a guy at the pharmacy get turned down for Claritin-D because he said he had "the symptoms" when asked why he was buying it.
