This file contains some of the datasets that were used in CLUTO's manual
to illustrate the various algorithms. A brief description of them is
as follows:

genes1.mat         => Microarray gene expression dataset 
genes2.mat         => Microarray gene expression dataset
k1b.mat            => Sparse document dataset
sports.mat         => Sparse document dataset
tr23.mat           => Sparse document dataset
tr23.graph         => The all-to-all similarity matrix for 
                      tr23 it can be used as input to scluster
t4.mat             => Synthetic 2D spatial dataset 
t7.mat             => Synthetic 2D spatial dataset
