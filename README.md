### Prerequisites


	-JDk 1.7 or greater
	 
	-Python
	 -nltk
	 -pandas
	 -numpy
	 -scipy
	 
### Basic Usage

#### Example
To run *FairSumm* on *Claritin* dataset with *equal representation* fairness notion for a summary of 50 tweets, execute the following command from the project home directory:<br/>
	``python FairSumm.py --input Claritin --notion equal --length 50``

#### Options
You can check out the other options available to use with *FairSumm* using:<br/>
	``python FairSumm.py --help``

#### Input
The supported input text file format is as following:

	-Tweets to summarize
	 -tweetId<||>tweetLabel<||>tweetText
	 
	-Similarity between tweets
	 -.csv file with similarity scores between tweets

#### Output
The obtained summary of specified number of tweets will get stored in the *Summaries* folder.<br/>
Rouge 1 and Rouge 2 Recall and F-scores will be stored in Final\_Output.txt in the following order (separated by tabs):

	 -SummaryName	Rouge-1 Recall	Rouge-1 F-Score	Rouge-2 Recall	Rouge2- F-Score


### Miscellaneous

Please send any questions you might have about the code and/or the algorithm to <dash.abhi93@iitkgp.ac.in>.

*Note:* This is only a reference implementation of the *FairSumm* algorithm and could benefit from several performance enhancement schemes, some of which are discussed in the paper.
