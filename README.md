### Prerequisites

*JDK 1.7 or greater

*Python modules
*nltk
*pandas
*numpy
*scipy

### Basic Usage

#### Example
To run *FairSumm* on Claritin dataset with equal representation fairness notion for a summary of 50 tweets, execute the following command from the project home directory:<br/>
	``python FairSumm.py --input Claritin --notion equal --length 50``

#### Options
You can check out the other options available to use with *FairSumm* using:<br/>
	``python FairSumm.py --help``

#### Input
The supported input text file format is as following:
	-Tweets
	 -tweet id<||>tweet label<||>tweet text
	 
	-Similarity between tweets
	 -.csv file with similarity scores between tweets

#### Output
The output file is a summary of *length* number of tweets stored in the *Summaries* folder. 

### Miscellaneous

Please send any questions you might have about the code and/or the algorithm to <dash.abhi93@iitkgp.ac.in>.

*Note:* This is only a reference implementation of the *FairSumm* algorithm and could benefit from several performance enhancement schemes, some of which are discussed in the paper.
