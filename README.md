### Prerequisites


	-JDk 1.7 or greater
	 
	-Python
	 -nltk
	 -pandas
	 -numpy
	 -scipy
	 
### Basic Usage

#### Example
To run *FairSumm* on *Claritin* dataset with *equal representation* fairness notion for a summary of 50 tweets, execute the following command from the project home directory:<br/>
	``python FairSumm.py --file Claritin.txt``<br/>

#### Options
You can check out the other options available to use with *FairSumm* using:<br/>
	``python FairSumm.py --help``

#### Datasets
We use three tweet datasets [*can be found in the dataset folder*] related to (a) Claritin drug side-effects, (b) MeToo movement and (c) US-presidential election to generate fair summaries. (Details can be found in the paper)

#### Input
The supported input text file format is as following:
	
	-Input file for FairSumm.py (Default settings is for equal representation fairness notion.) 
	-You need to change it as per your requirements by giving the desired number of tweets from each classes.
	
	 -input<||>input dataset
	 -length<||>length of the output summary
	 -num_groups<||>number of socially salient groups in the dataset
	 -group1<||>required number tweets in the final summary
	 -group2<||>required number tweets in the final summary
	
	-Tweets to summarize
	 -tweetId<||>tweetLabel<||>tweetText
	 
	-Similarity between tweets
	 -.csv file with similarity scores between tweets (To be generated)

Claritin.txt, METOO.txt and US-Election.txt are sample input files for generating summaries of length 50 tweets that follow the equal represenation fairness notion, from the three datasets respectively.

#### Output
The obtained summary of specified number of tweets for the dataset will get stored in the *Summaries* folder in the name of the input dataset. (Will get created)<br/>

If you set the evaluation variable to 1 then Rouge scores will be evaluated and stored as described below: <br/>
Rouge 1 and Rouge 2 Recall and F-scores will be stored in an additional file- Final\_Output.txt (will get created) in the following order (separated by tabs) in the parent directory:

	 -SummaryName	Rouge-1 Recall	Rouge-1 F-Score	Rouge-2 Recall	Rouge2- F-Score

In case you need to add more human generated summary you can add them in the Test_Summaries folder of the corresponding dataset.

### Miscellaneous

Please send any questions you might have about the code and/or the algorithm to <dash.abhi93@iitkgp.ac.in>.

*Note:* This is only a reference implementation of the *FairSumm* algorithm and could benefit from several performance enhancement schemes, some of which are discussed in the paper.
