This file contains a simple perl script to convert a set of documents
into the vector-space format required by CLUTO.

To install it, edit the first line of the doc2mat file and set it to
the location that perl is installed in your system. Once this is done, 
you should then be able to run this script. It has been successfully 
tested with perl versions 5.6 and 5.8.  

Instructions on how to use it are available in doc2mat.html and can
be viewed by doing a 'doc2mat -help'.

The supplied ds1.raw file can be converted into a CLUTO compliant
mat-file using the command:
  
  doc2mat -nlskip=1 ds1.raw ds1.mat
