86003278 evaluation finger systolic pressure response local cooling the diagnosis primary raynaud phenomenon finger systolic pressure fsp response local cooling has been evaluated diagnostic test females with primary raynaud phenomenon prp the mean fsp degrees and degrees was significantly lower the patients than age and sex matched controls but there was large overlap the individual responses diagnostic sensitivity fsp degrees was only increasing the sensitivity the test lowered the specificity the number false positives rose this also reduced the predictive value for positive test diagnostic test prp individuals the measurement fsp appears limited value except severe cases when complete vessel closure often occurs measurement fsp will classify groups correctly and this objective physiological measure raynaud phenomenon may have place group comparisons
